# OpenTrons Protocol validator

This software validates OpenTrons Protocol JSON files. It requires both
a Protocol JSON file and a Containers JSON file to operate. It can also use
string and dictionary types instead of files.


A few TODO items:
1. Package protocol-validator module for pip install so no need for local copy.
2. Add logging to protocol-validator.
3. Add testing to protocol-validator.
4. Example of how to use here in the README
5. Return feedback on errors for improper inputs
